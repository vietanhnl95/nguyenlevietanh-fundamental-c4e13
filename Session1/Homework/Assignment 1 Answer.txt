1. How to check a variable’s type?
	Step1: Run Python
	Step 2: type(variable)

2. In what cases, you will get SyntaxError from the compiler telling you that some of your variables have invalid names? Can you give 3 different examples of invalid names?
	We will get SyntaxError for invalid variables' name when the variable has an invalid name:
	
	Ex1: Not begin with a letter or an underscore
	12abc = 40000
	
	Ex2: Contain illegal character
	Percent% = 40

	Ex3: Name is one of the Python keywords
	if = 1
